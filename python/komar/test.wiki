= KoMar - wiki-markup =

 == Philosophy ===
KoMar wiki-markup is meant to be: 
* easy to use
* easy to read
* consistent
* have enough features for everyday use

It's heavily based on
[[ http://wikicreole.org/wiki/Creole1.0 | Creole 1.0 ]] wiki-markup,
but there are some differences.


 == Syntax =
 
  === Text formatting
You can use: **bold text**, //italics text//, ~~strikethrough~~, 
^^superscript^^, ,,subscript,, and ``code snippets``. Inline elements
can be **combined //with each ~~other~~//**. Formatting **extends
between line breaks**. But unclosed formatting //does **not** leak...

...between block elements (paragraphs, list items, block quotes, etc).

Changing font colour and size is not supported yet.


  === Links
You can use links like this [[http://google.com/]] or with description
[[ http://google.com | Google ]] (use **|** between url and description,
you can even use formatting inside description like this: 
[[http://google.pl | G**o**,,g,,//l//^^e^^]]

Free links like http://google.com are not recognized, 
you must use \[[ and \]]! 
So far multiline link descriptions are not supported.
Creating anchors is on the TODO list.


  === Images
To insert image use {{http://www.google.pl/intl/en_com/images/logo_plain.png}}
You can also add ALT text for images: {{ /invalid.jpg | INVALID url! }}  
  
  
  === Block elements

   ==== Headers
Just start the line with = for <h1>, == for <h2> and so on, up to <h6>.
Closing ='s are not displayed and can be ommited.
   
   
   ==== Paragraph
Paragraphs are created automatically. You can use multiple
lines
when
writing
a paragraph. 
If you want to create new parapgraph just put...
      
...blank line after the previous one. Using \\ you can create linebreak.
It doesn't matter if linebreak is on the end of line\\
or in \\ the middle of the line.
   
   
   ==== List
* You can use unordered lists
    * to nest the list just indent asterisk
    * if you want you can use
      multiline list items or use \\ linebreak
        # you can mix unordered and ordered lists
        # you can even add preformated text inside list item like
{{{
this 

**not bold!***
}}}
and continue the list item here
        * or mix both list types on the same indent level
    * you can use **formatting** like in ^^normal^^ text
# and unclosed //formatting
# won't leak to the next list item
# you **can't** nest blockquote inside list item.
   
   
   ==== Blockquote
> Just start the line with > to create the blockquote, just like quotes 
> in the e-mail client. \\
> You don't have to put > at the beginning of the line if you want to
write multiline blockquote. Put a blank line to end it.

> You can also 
>> nest blockquote 
(even multiline) inside
> another blockquote element.

At this point you can't nest lists or preformatted code inside 
blockquote.
   
   
   ==== Preformatted text
If you start the line with:
{{{
Text will be put inside <pre> tag
    This means that all the linebreaks and whitespaces are preserved.
   Also no **formatting** //will// ^^be^^ ,,used,, (or \**escaping)
 * lists
 * and
> blockquotes
Will not be created

If you want to end preformatted text use:
}}}
Further text will be treated as paragraph.
   
   ==== Horizontal line
Horizontal line can be created by using four or more hyphens in a line
 ----- 
Horizontal lines, like blank lines and headers will close all previous
block elements.
  
  
  === Escape character and inline nowiki
To escape formatting, linebreak use \** \// \,, \^^ \~~ \\\
\[[http://google.com]]

You can use {{{inline **nowiki**}}}, {{{{{{ **test** }}}}}} if you don't 
want wiki markup to be parsed

\----

\= It's not a header! =

 === HTML
It is not possible to use HTML inside KoMar wiki-markup. 

>, < and & are changed to &gt;, &lt; and &amp;

== TODO:

There are still some features to be implemented:
 * font colour and size
 * tables
 * video embedding 
 * anchors <a name="foo" /> [[:foo]] [[:foo|bar]]
 * block elements inside blockquote
 * defining language in <pre> {{{:css
 * #title - title, #more, #! - comment
